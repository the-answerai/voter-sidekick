The bill aims to establish regulations regarding artificial intelligence models and their development in California.\n\nKey provisions of SB-1047 include:\n\n1. **Creation of the Board of Frontier Models**: The bill establishes a Board of Frontier Models within the Government Operations Agency, independent of the Department of Technology. This board will be responsible for regulating the development and deployment of artificial intelligence models.\n\n2. **Regulations for Developers**: It mandates that developers of \"covered models\" must implement capabilities for a prompt full shutdown and maintain a written safety and security protocol. The developers are required to retain an unredacted copy of these protocols for five years after the model is made publicly available and to grant the Attorney General access to these protocols.\n\n3. **Assessment of Digital Content**: The bill requires the Secretary of Government Operations to coordinate a plan to evaluate the impact of deepfakes and to explore standards for digital content provenance (the origin of digital content).\n\n4. **Establishment of CalCompute**: It proposes the creation of a public cloud computing cluster known as \"CalCompute\" to advance safe, ethical, and sustainable AI research and innovation.\n\n5. **Legislative Findings**: The bill contains legislative findings that acknowledge California's leadership in AI innovation and the potential benefits AI could bring to various sectors, including medicine.\n\n6. **Regulatory Updates and Reporting**: The Government Operations Agency is required to issue annual regulations to update the definition of \"covered model\" and to submit reports to the Legislature regarding the framework established for CalCompute.\n\nOverall, SB-1047 aims to ensure the safe and responsible development of artificial intelligence technologies in California while addressing public safety concerns related to proprietary information and digital integrity (Source: [SB-1047, Pages 1-4](#)). \n\nIf you need more specific information or details about certain sections, feel free to ask! \n\nSuggested follow-up questions:\n:::followupquestions\nWhat are the definitions provided in SB-1047 for \"covered models\"?\nHow does SB-1047 address concerns related to public safety?\nWhat are the implications of the establishment of CalCompute? \n:::",

The bill would require \na  developer,  beginning  January  1,  2026,  to  annually  retain  a  \nthird-party auditor to perform an independent audit of compliance \nwith  those  provisions,  as  prescribed.  The  bill  would  require  the  \nauditor to produce an audit report, as prescribed, and would require \na developer to retain an unredacted copy of the audit report for as \nlong  as  the  covered  model  is  made  available  for  commercial,  \npublic,  or  foreseeably  public  use  plus  5  years.  The  bill  would  \nrequire a developer to grant to the Attorney General access to the \nunredacted auditor’s report upon request. The bill would exempt \nfrom disclosure under the California Public Records Act the safety \nand security protocol and the auditor’s report described above. \nThis bill would require a developer of a covered model to submit \nto  the  Attorney  General  a  statement  of  compliance  with  these  \nprovisions, as specified. The bill would also require a developer \nof  a  covered  model  to  report  each  artificial  intelligence  safety  \nincident  affecting  the  covered  model  or  any  covered  model  \nderivative controlled by the developer to the Attorney General, as \nprescribed. \nThis  bill  would  require  a  person  that  operates  a  computing  \ncluster, as defined, to implement written policies and procedures \nto do certain things when a customer utilizes compute resources \nthat would be sufficient to train a covered model, including assess \nwhether a prospective customer intends to utilize the computing \ncluster to train a covered model. \nThis bill would authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil \naction, as provided. The bill would also provide for whistleblower \nprotections,  including  by  prohibiting  a  developer  of  a  covered  \nmodel  or  a  contractor  or  subcontractor  of  the  developer  from  \npreventing an employee from disclosing information, or retaliating \nagainst  an  employee  for  disclosing  information,  to  the  Attorney  \nGeneral or Labor Commissioner if the employee has reasonable \ncause to believe the information indicates the developer is out of \ncompliance with certain requirements or that the covered model \nposes an unreasonable risk of critical harm. \n88 \nSB 1047 \n— 3 — \n  ",
