            In what many are calling the most consequential election of our
            lifetime, we face an unprecedented challenge: how do we maintain
            faith in our democratic process when trust in institutions is at an
            all-time low? As we approach the 2024 election, it&apos;s clear that
            no matter which side loses, the results will likely be contested.
            We&apos;ll face a tsunami of legal challenges, disputed ballots, and
            complex policy documents‚Äîall while being bombarded with
            misinformation from every direction.

            The Problem We&apos;re Solving
          </h2>
          <p>
            The gap between what politicians say in public and what they argue
            in court has never been wider. Take, for example, the stark contrast
            in statements about election fraud in 2020:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pt-2 ml-4">
            <li>
              <strong>In Public</strong>: &ldquo;This is a fraud on the American
              public... We know there was massive fraud. It was a rigged
              election 100%.&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In Court</strong>: &ldquo;This is not a fraud case... We
              are not alleging fraud in this lawsuit.&rdquo;
            </li>
          </ul>

              Addressing the AI Elephant in the Room
            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-yellow-700">
              Yes, AI can make things up. We&apos;ve all heard about
              hallucination in AI models. But here&apos;s the difference: Voter
              Sidekick isn&apos;t asking AI to generate information‚Äîit&apos;s
              using AI to find and present information that already exists in
              verified documents. Every response includes direct citations,
              allowing users to verify the information themselves. Think of it
              this way: courts are the last remaining guardrail where standards
              of evidence still matter. What&apos;s said in a courtroom, under
              evidence still matter. What&apos;s said in a courtroom, under
              oath, carries different weight than what&apos;s posted on social
              media. Our tool helps highlight these crucial differences.
